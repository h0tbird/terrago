# Terrago

This git repository contains one Go module with one Go package at the root directory and two internal Go
packages that are not publicly accessible. The internal packages are generated by the `make dag-code` target.

The module path is `github.com/h0tbird/terrago` which is also the import path used for the root directory.
It is intended to be consumed as a library by adding the `import "github.com/h0tbird/terrago"` statement to
your code.

### Architecture
A `Manifest` is a collection of `Resource`s stored in a hash table and its corresponding dependency DAG.
When a `Manifest` is applied, the DAG is generated and walked and that's when `Resource`s are reconciled.

### Development
Upgrade all dependencies at once:
```
go mod edit -go=1.16
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy
```
